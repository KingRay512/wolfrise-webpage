          <h1>The year is 1955.</h1>

          <p>As the cold war was just beginning to brew, the world was met with a terrible shock. The long-thought defeated Nazi War Machine had resurrected, as if from out of thin air. As they quickly moved to capture key infrastructure and subjugate the population, many nations the world over soon found themselves at the total and complete mercy of their new captors. Along with the amazing speed and precision at which they carried out this operation, this Blitzkrieg's success was also due in part to a new, never-before seen weapon. The occupying forces have been heard only referring to them as the "Ubermensch" - tall, bipedal monstrosities made of metal, towering over even the tallest of men. These advanced walking weapons platforms soon made short work of most of the world's conventional forces.</p>

          <p>However, just as all hope in the world seemed to be lost, there was still one man in the world that could change the tide of this one-sided struggle. Agent William Joseph Blazkowicz.</p>
